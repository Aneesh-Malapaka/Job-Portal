Live-Demo - jobs-for-you.great-site.net
This project is a part of the internship for front-end web development and basic use of PHP and MySQL to process data and store it.
A Job portal consisting of various components within to do the following

Admin Side (index.php)
-> Post a new job
-> View applied candidates for available jobs

Candidate Side (career.php)
-> Check available jobs 
-> Apply for new jobs

Future Enhancements:
-> Create a seperate view for every different company.
-> Create a clear view for candidate login and admin login.
-> Use prepared statement and other ways to avoid SQL attacks.
